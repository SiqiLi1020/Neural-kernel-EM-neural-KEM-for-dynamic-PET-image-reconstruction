# Prerequistites:
	Python 3.7 (or 3.x)
	PyTorch
	Matlab R2021a

# Overview
The neural KEM reconstuction consists of two separate steps: 
(1) a KEM step for image update from the projection data
(2) a deep-learning step in the image domain for updating the kernel coefficient image

# Neural KEM for dynamic PET reconstruction:

a). 	You can run 'demo_Nerual_KEM.m' to test the proposed method on Zubal phantom simulation that we used in the paper.

b).	'DIP_OT.py' is a function to run the step of deep coefficient prior (deep learning), and the whole reconstruction is implemented on Matlab

c).	The proposed method is to optimize kernel coefficient that can be complementary for our recent work "deep kernel". You can change conventional kernel 
	kernel matrix as improved deep kernel. Details please see line 125 in 'demo_Nerual_KEM.m'.

# Required packages for PET reconstruction:

a).	To use this package, you need to add the KER_v0.11 package into your matlab path by
  	running setup.m in matlab. KER_v0.11 package can be downloaded from:

	https://wanglab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/code

b).	To test the algorithms in the package, run "demo_Neural_KEM.m" in the current folder. You
  	may need your own system matrix G or use Jeff Fessler's IRT matlab toolbox to 
  	generate one. IRT can downloaded from 
  
      	http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/index.html
